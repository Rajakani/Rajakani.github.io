<em>I like my code to be neat and reader friendly. If the flow is understandable in a single view, and the naming conventions are self explanatory then it gives the reader a pleasant experience. When I come back to the code later, say in a week or a month and still feel great about it then it has obviously cleared my litmus test interms of quality. A perfect piece of code conveys one thing at a time. Similar to an art, coding can also turn perfect with practice. Practice comes by referring different codes and writing app-code till you are satisfied.  </em>
