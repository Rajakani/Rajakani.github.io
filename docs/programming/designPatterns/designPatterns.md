# Design Patterns

### What is a Design Pattern
Design pattern is a repeatable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software design. 

### Who need to learn that
Every developer in the Team!

### Why we need to learn it
There are many patterns which are in common use, but many developers are not able to identify it. Learning this helps in easing the communication between team members. 
Instead of saying write the code in which the dependant classes needs to passed in as dependency, Simply say use [Factory Pattern]({% link docs/programming/designPatterns/factoryPattern.md %}).

### What are the benefits of applying patterns
No immediate benefits. If you are working on a small application with clear requirements, dont bother about adding patterns. 
But if you are into serious business in which the requirements change over time, consider using patterns. 

### Where to apply all these patterns
Don't attempt to add patterns to your application since you are interested in patterns a lot. Look for coding problems you face in your application, which can be solved by using patterns. Also be aware that some patterns make the code difficult to understand. So use them wisely.

### When to apply patterns
Patterns are nothing but different implementations of [SOLID Principles]({% link docs/programming/solidPrinciples.md %}). So sooner the better. 
If you are working on a mature/Legacy applications, you need to refactor a lot. Dont apply patterns for the sake of applying it. 

### How many patterns I may need to learn.
Possibly all of them from the GOF patterns. There are 23 to be exact. Don't need to worry much now. 
Learn about the scenarios where the pattern can be applied. 

### How to start learning Design Patterns
So if you are a developer who just started learning design patterns, start with simple patterns like Strategy or Factory pattern. 
Learn them slowly and work with as many as use cases you can think of. You will start to understand them better.

Happy Learning!
