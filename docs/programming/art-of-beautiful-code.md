> &quot;*I like my code to be neat and reader friendly. If the flow is understandable in a single view, and the naming conventions are self explanatory then it gives the reader a pleasant experience.* &quot;

Usually when I come back to my code later, say in a week or a month and still feel great about it then it has obviously cleared my litmus test interms of quality. 
A perfect piece of code conveys one thing at a time. 
Similar to an art, coding can also turn perfect with practice. It doesn't means the writing more code, but by understanding the library implemenatations or learning new programming languages.
