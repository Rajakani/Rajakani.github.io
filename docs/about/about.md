![Skill set ](\assets\images\skillset-cloud.png)

I am a Technical lead and a budding Architect with 12 plus years of experience in multiple Domains and technologies.

I’ve been blogging for more than 3 years now, more or less consistently — although sometimes I stopped for too long. I recently revamped the blog and started to write consistently, to the point I now write every week.

I learn new things every day. Most of the content that I end up writing here are those I got while researching a topic.
If I can't explain it in simple terms, then I haven't fully understood the topic. I believe in this and so blogging helps me in explaining things.
