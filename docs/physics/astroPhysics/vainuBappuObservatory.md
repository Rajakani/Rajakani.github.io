## First visit to an astronomical observatory
Taking a break after lunch and I was exploring places in and around Vellore during the Pongal Holidays. Found this place through a google search, with no second thought we started the drive to Vainu Bappu Observatory, which is 70 km from Vellore. Since its already around 4:30 PM, we took the shortest route via National Highway. There are two other ways we can reach this place, one via Polur and another via Asanampattu. We avoided it this time since both these roads were through Jawadhu reserve forest area. 

We reached Kavalur around 6:30 and luckily its open on Saturdays for public visit in the evenings, provided its a clear sky. Once the sky started getting Darker, we were allowed inside to view through the 4" telescope. We were able to focus on Jupiter and Saturn, with its rings. 
Even its smaller in size, Its such a bliss to know that I never know thats Jupiter we could even see from naked eye, till that date. 

We were completely unprepared and have no knowledge of the place, even I didnt see the Large mounted telescope. (I got to know only after coming home and searching in wiki later). We were so happy that day and had dinner there in the hilltop itself. 

On the way back, thought of taking the Asanampattu route, since it covers lesser forest area than the Polur route. It was my first drive through a forest during night time, for around 15 Kms we were the only humans transiting that way, literally sitting scared. 

## Second Visit to the Observatory
This time we are better prepared, carried a binocular and we took the Polur route, which mostly covers the scenic Jawadhu hills, alongside the roads theres a lot of some yellow colored flower farms, Still I dont know much about the name Jawadhu(a scent) and the relation between this place. 
We stopped for a short break at the hilltop in Jamanaputhur. The forest starts from this village, we enjoyed sights of some Wild boar and Indian Gaur, most of the route is through forest but we started early this time. 

On reaching the Observatory, we know this place a step further now, Instead using the 4" telescope, we used our Binos, First time we spotted Satellites in N-Numbers, i know that we could see satellites from earth, but never experienced one. Even with a 10X50 binocular we could see the Orion Nebula, and some clusters, which is again amazing to experience for the first time. No words could describe that. 

Some impatient crowd, started noticing us from the 4" telescope queue, a guy from the queue asked me for the Bino, later it kept on transferred to all persons from that group. I could see everyone is eager in seeing the moon, but I restrained from seeing Brighter objects. Somehow we managed to get the binos back :). This time we again took the Asanampattu route, after our dinner from the same shop. This time we know the route better :). 

Came to know that the observatory itself is open for visitors, if we reach there in the morning time. Hoping to visit once after this Covid-19 gets over :)
