## First visit to an Astronomical Observatory
It was one fine evening during the Pongal Holidays of 2019, sitting in the couch relaxing after the lunch. While exploring places in and around Vellore, found this place on a google search. Without any second thoughts we started our drive to Vainu Bappu Observatory in Kavalur, which is around 70 km from Vellore. Since its was around 4:30 PM, we took the shortest route via National Highway whilst there are two other ways to reach this place, one via Polur and other via Asanampattu. We avoided these routes as both these roads were through the Jawadhu hills reserve forest area. 

We reached Kavalur around 6:30 PM and luckily it was open for public visit that day.
The evening visit is allowed only if the sky is clear and only on Saturdays.
It started getting darker and after which we were allowed to star gaze through the 4" telescope set up for public display. It is an old Carl Zeiss make through which we were able to focus the Jupiter and Saturn, with its rings. Though the planets looked smaller, it was such a bliss to witness it and surprising to know that one could see Jupiter with naked eye.

> Kavalur was chosen to set up this Observatory as it is away from the City and has lesser light pollution which increases visibility in the night sky.

We were unprepared for the visit as we had no prior idea about the place and missed to notice the Large mounted telescope in the Observatory, which was the center of attraction there. We realized it after returning back and learned about the place. At the hill top we were elated to relish a delicious dinner in a small hotel which served food in a traditional cooking style that I am addicted to.

It was an adventurous decision on our way back to take the Asanampattu route, as it covers lesser forest area than the Polur route. My first forest drive during the night and for around 15 Kms it was such a scary drive in complete darkness and not a human to find around with cicadas buzzing all the way in the cold night.

## Second Visit to the Observatory
This time we were prepared and started earlier with a binocular via the Polur route. The scenic Jawadhu hills, was serene with yellow flowers. Not sure if there exists a relation between the famous scent Jawadhu and these flowers.

We stopped at Jamanaputhur, a village at the hilltop for a cup of tea while we also purchased fresh vegetables and continued to Kavalur. The forest area starts from this village and we enjoyed the sight of few wild boars and an Indian Gaur. Soon after covering some distance through the forest, we sighed that we didn't choose this route during our first visit as Vellore forest dept says that elephants and leopard are common inhabitants of this region. 

On reaching the Observatory, we used our Celestron 10X50 Binocular and for the first time I could spot some satellites scooping the skies with high speed. I knew that we can spot satellites from earth but never experienced one before. Even with our basic binocular we could see the Orion Nebula and a star cluster, which was an amazing experience.

It was a very satisfying visit and we also heard that there's a guest house nearby and they provide trekking with guidance. The main telescope can also be visited for a technical tour which is open only during the day time.

This place is a must visit for people who are interested in star gazing and wanting to know more about astronomy.

After our dinner from the same hotel, We returned back by the same route taken last time. 

Waiting to visit once again after the Covid-19 pandemic settles, possibly with my own telescope :)
