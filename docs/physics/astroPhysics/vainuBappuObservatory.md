## First visit to an Astronomical Observatory
It was a sloppy evening during the Pongal Holidays of 2019, sitting in the crouch and taking a break after lunch. I was exploring places in and around Vellore and found this place through a google search, with no second thought we started the drive to Vainu Bappu Observatory in Kavalur, which is around 70 km from Vellore. Since its already around 4:30 PM, we took the shortest route via National Highway. There are two other ways to reach this place, one via Polur and another via Asanampattu. We avoided it this time since both these roads were through Jawadhu hills reserve forest area. 

We reached Kavalur around 6:30 and luckily its open on Saturdays for public visit in the evenings, provided its a clear sky. Once the sky started getting Darker, we were allowed inside to view through the 4" telescope. Its an old Carl Zeiss make.  We were able to focus on Jupiter and Saturn, with its rings. Even its smaller in size, its such a bliss to see that. I never know thats Jupiter we could even see naked eye, till that date. 

We were completely unprepared and have no knowledge of the place, even I didn't noticed the Large mounted telescope in the Observatory. (I got to know only after coming home and searching in wiki later). We were so happy that day and had a delicious food there in the hilltop itself in a small hotel, though I am great fan of wood cooked food from village areas.

We were adventurous on the way back, thought of taking the Asanampattu route, since it covers lesser forest area than the Polur route. It was my first drive through a forest during night time, for around 15 Kms we were the only humans transiting that way, with utter darkness surrounding and locusts sound everywhere, literally sitting scared and shivering in mist.

## Second Visit to the Observatory
This time we are better prepared, carried a binocular and we took the Polur route and started earlier this time. En-route the scenic Jawadhu hills, there's a lot of farms covered with some yellow colored flower, Still I couldn't relate the name Jawadhu(a scent) with this forest name. Maybe identifying this flower will have some answers, I hope. 

We stopped for a short break at the hilltop in Jamanaputhur. Brought some fresh vegetables and started to Kavalur. The forest area starts from this village, we enjoyed the sights of some Wild boar and Indian Gaur. Soon after covering some distance through the forest, we sighed that we didn't took this route the first time. Vellore forest dept website says that elephants and leopard are inhabitants of this region. 

On reaching the Observatory, we know this place a step further now, Instead using the 4" telescope, we directly used our Binoculars, first time I spotted some Satellites scooping the sky in high speed, I know that we could see satellites from earth, but never experienced one. Even with a 10X50 binocular we could see the Orion Nebula, and some clusters, which is again amazing to experience for the first time. No words could describe that. 

Some impatient crowd, started noticing us from the 4" telescope queue, a guy from the queue asked me for the Binoculars, later it kept on transferred to all persons from that group. I could see everyone is eager in seeing the moon, but I restrained from seeing Brighter objects. Somehow we managed to get our binoculars back :). Again a satisfying visit, heard that there's guest house nearby and can take guided trekking. Also learnt that the main telescope can also be visited for a technical tour. 

This time again we took the Asanampattu route, after our dinner from the same shop. This time we know this route better :). 

Hoping to visit once after this Covid-19 gets over :)
