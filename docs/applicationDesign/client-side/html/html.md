Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) tells a browser how to display the content of web pages, while [CSS]({% link docs/applicationDesign/client-side/css/css.md %}) styles that content.

## WHAT Is HYPERTEXT-MARKUP-LANGUAGE
Hypertext defines the link between the web pages. The texts including links in the document are **marked up** with a set of symbols known as tags to indicate how the file should look when it is printed on screen. It defines the document's logical structure.

## THEN WHATS A MARKDOWN
Markdown is a type of markup, which is simpler than the HTML syntax.
