Separation of concerns, as the name suggests it helps each module or layer in an application handle only one thing and should not contain additional responsibilities. Separating concerns reduces code complexity and more maintainable.

## EXAMPLES

### HTML AND CSS
Traditionally [HTML](html.md) handles both content and styles. But later [CSS](css.md) made styling more modular and helped changing application looks easier.
