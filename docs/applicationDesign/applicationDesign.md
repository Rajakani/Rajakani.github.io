## developer story

&quot;*I like my code to be neat and maintenance friendly. If the flow is understandable and the naming conventions are self explanatory then it makes life easier while doing maintenance. If I come back to the code later, say in a week or a month and still feel great about it then it has obviously cleared my litmus test in terms of quality. A perfect piece of code conveys one thing and does the same. Similar to an art, coding can also be turned perfect with practice. So keep practicing... refer different code libraries... and refactor your code... and write perfect code next time you start.* &quot;
