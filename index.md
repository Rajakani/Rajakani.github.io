## My Developer Story
{: .fs-9 }

A blog is useful for many reasons. It can become a source of leads, it can be the place where, in the future, you might sell your products if you want to become an indie developer, or it can simply be the place where you have your audience and express your ideas.

I’ve been blogging for more than 3 years now, more or less consistently — although sometimes I stopped for too long. I recently revamped the blog and started to write consistently, to the point I now write every week. I’ve already seen a lot of good results.

Also, the best moment to teach something is right after you’ve learned it, because you remember how not knowing about it feels.

I learn new things every day. Around 50% of what I end up writing I just learned while researching a topic.

If we cant explain it in simple terms, we havent fully understood the topic. Blogging helps me in explaining things.
